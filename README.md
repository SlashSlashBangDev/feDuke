# feDuke

The Iron Duke Game Engine, stylized as feDuke, is a game engine doomed to forever be in development. This engine is written as an educational project instead of a commercial or community offering, any use outside of this narrow scope is unsupported and ill advised. The raison d'etre of feDuke is to provide its creator an avenue to explore topics within Game Engine development. 

Engine Features (subject to change):

- [ ] 3D Graphics  
- [ ] Lighting (Specifics TBD) 
- [ ] Content Pipeline Tools  
- [ ] 3D Audio
- [ ] Physics Engine
- [ ] (MORE TO COME)

The list of features is going to be dynamic, driven largely on by topics that the author finds interesting. Because this is not designed to be a commercial product, the author will most likely get certain systems to a state of "good enough" as a MVP, and then if there is an interest continue diving into optimizations and more details.  

Learning Objectives
- Graphics Programming
  - OpenGl
  - Vulkan
- Audio Programming
- API Design
- Physics Programming
- Managing a large code base
  - Refactoring
  - Using Git correctly
- Game Engine Architecture 
- Being a customer of my own code

This is the real point, These are just a few of the things the developer wants to gain experience with.
